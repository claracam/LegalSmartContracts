Many times we develop code without being aware of the potential legal implications of publishing, running or authoring it.
Like a toddler playing in a pool, it's definitely fun - but it comes with a little speech and risk warning from mum.
To avoid drowning in your pool, I've created this repo listing some of the most typical use cases for smart contracts and explaining legal risks, jurisdictional issues, or compliance notes.
All legal comments are based on international principles of law that are generally applied across jurisdictions, unless a specific jurisdiction is stated.
Contributions regarding deep dives, other jurisdictions that haven't been listed or that regulate the topic differently, are very welcome!

Hopefully this will make us a little less scared of talking legalese.

ðŸ’¦ Pools are fun, don't drown ðŸ¤Ÿ
